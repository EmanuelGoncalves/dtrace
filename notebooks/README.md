Notebooks
--

This folder contains the analysis notebooks used to generate all the results. Plots generated from the analysis are 
displayed within the notebooks and saved independently as PDFs in the *notebooks/reports* folder.

Python scripts can be automatically converted to jupyter notebooks using jupytext (`pip install jupytext`)
```
jupytext --to ipynb 1.PreliminaryAnalysis.py
```
